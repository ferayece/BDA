###### Part 1: Questions about Statistical and Optimization Techniques for Laundry Portfolio Optimization at Procter & Gamble ##########
# 1)) As I understand, they decide the mixture ingredient compositions at the end of the  predictive models. It means P&G produce the some products 
# according to output of this solution, so why did not mention about health? 
# Is not health an important constraint while the output of the modeling is the mixture of some chemical ingredients?
# 2)) Under the 'Implementation and Usage' header, There is 'Team and Workflow' part. On this part, there are 9 step for implementation. 
#8.step is 'Churn and Analysis'. As Ä± understand on this step, all team members are enforcing the optimization engine with some scenerios.
#I did not understand why all team members should strain the engine, why not just functional experts?
