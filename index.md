I decided to use my github repo as a diary of my master program. Because I am reaally really messy, so [i am cleanin' out my closet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ9_TKayu9s) 

## Intro to Machine Learning (BDA 505)

+ Introduction to machine learning algorithms with python and scikit-learn library. 

+ I've completed following online courses for this lecture:

    - [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud120)
    - [Machine Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud262)

+ I followed Aurélien Géron's "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" book and Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning Yearning-Draft" book for this lecture. 

+ [second assignment](/files/BDA502ML/BDA_502_Assignment2_FerayEceTopcu.pdf) and [third assignment](/files/BDA502ML/BDA_502_Assignment3_FerayEceTopcu.pdf) can be found on the repo.  

+ [Term Project Report](/files/BDA502ML/TermProject.pdf) about Customer Segmentation. 

+ [Here](https://github.com/ferayece/BDA/tree/master/files/BDA502ML/codes) is my repo directory for ML codes.

+ [Here](/files/BDA502ML/ML_Algos_Cheatsheet.jpg) is the cheatsheet for summary of ML. 

+ [Here](https://github.com/ferayece/BDA/blob/master/files/BDA502ML/ML_Cheatsheet1.png) is the cheatsheet to decide ML algorithm due to some parameters such that data, speed, accuracy and etc. 


## B.D. Management -If you can manage- (BDA 505)

+ Some hard-core stuff about Big Data Technologies such that Hadoop, Dockers, PostGreSQL and etc. 

+ [Here](/files/BDA505/) is all sources for this lecture.

+ [Here](/files/BDA505/20180105_International_2.html) is the team project report of the lecture. The project is playing with  The U.S. Census Bureau's International Dataset. Data is stored in PostGreSQL database and R is used for descriptive analysis.


## Playing Data with Python (BDA 507)

+ This lecture is "Intro to Programming for Big Data" with Python. Mostly descriptive analytics with Python.

+ I've completed following Datacamp course for this lecture:

  - [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) 

+ The report of the term project is [available](/files/BDA507Python/BDA 507-Term Project Report Feray Ece Topcu.pdf). The source code of the project is also [available](/files/BDA507Python/starbucks_term_project.py). The term project is using Starbucks Location Data for descriptive analysis. 

+ The answer of final exam can be found on [repo](/files/BDA507Python/Final_Exam.py)

+ [Here](https://github.com/ferayece/BDA/tree/master/files/BDA507Python) is my repo directory for Python codes.


## One more cup of coffee for R (BDA 503)

+ R for data analysis.

+ I completed following Datacamp courses for this lecture:

  - [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)
  - [Data Visualization with R](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-visualization-with-r)
  - [Importing & Cleaning Data with R](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/importing-cleaning-data-with-r)

+ [Here](https://mef-bda503.github.io/pj-ferayece/) is my progress journal with R, from bottom to top. 

+ [Here](https://mef-bda503.github.io/gpj-datamunglers-2/) is the website of team works. 

+ [Here](https://github.com/ferayece/BDA/tree/master/BDA503R/Cheatsheets/) is useful cheatsheets to start R. 

+ Data file for final exam is [available](/files/BDA503R/mainData.RData)

## Intro to Statistics (BDA 501)

+ Basic statistical methods for understanding the data.

+ All slides shared by Instructor are [available](https://github.com/ferayece/BDA/tree/master/files/BDA501/all_slides/) 

+ I completed following Udacity courses for this lecture:

  - [Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud827)
  - [Intro to Inferential Statistics](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud201)
